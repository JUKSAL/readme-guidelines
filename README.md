# Template for a decent README.md

Repository's README.md is the best gift you can give to a new developer.
It gives him/her a brisk start to understand what repo is all about, what it's purpose is, how to start coding and
contributing, and most importantly how successfully maintain codebase and the app/software that comes out of the code.

This repository consists of two template files that serve slightly different purpose:

[blank/README.md](blank/README.md) contains only the topics that README.md could contain

[guided/README.md](guided/README.md) contains topics and some guidelines and hints of the content for topics


Every software is different. There can't be one ultimate README.md template that one can just fill and that's it. 
On the contrary, to successfully fulfill the purpose of the README.md, use your own experience and identify
with a (new) developer, e.g.
* What are the things you would like to know when you hit to a new repository and your job is to code, contribute and maintain it?
* How you can save everybody's time by documenting things that would otherwise need code digging, 
hunt down an expert or just banging your head on the wall.


This template gives you an idea of what a good README.md could contain, it's not a "form" to fill.


README.md is from a developer to a developer. Be a good developer.
